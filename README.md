# Supplementary Workshop #1 - Introduction to scientific Python

## Prerequisites
- familiarity with basic programming concepts (variables, loops, conditionals, etc.)

## Overview
    We want our workshops to be accessible to everyone who wants to learn the principles of data science. After receiving a lot of incredible feedback for the first event, we have decided to organise a supplementary scientific Python workshop. During a two hour event you will be working in small groups and learn the essentials of Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scipy. If you are just getting started with the scientific Python stack, this is the perfect learning opportunity! Attending this workshop will equip you with the skills necessary to follow our future machine learning oriented events easily.

## Agenda
    1. **Introuduction to Numpy**
    - array creation
    - indexing and shapes
    - mathematical operations and broadcasting
    - basic linear algebra
    - data types

    2. **Introduction to Matplotlib**
    - plotting data
    - titles, legends and labels
    - subplots and the object-oriented interface
    - displaying images

    3. **Optimization with Scipy**
    - linear regression with Scipy
